This folder contains the code to replicate Figure 4 in A fast non-reversible MCMC scheme for Bayesian finite mixture models (Ascolani and Zanella).

It includes the following files:

- "Functions_highDim.R", which contains the functions to implement both reversible and non-reversible samplers.

- "Normal_highDim.R", which contains the code to replicate Figure 4. See Section 6.3 for the details of the simulation.
