This folder contains the code to replicate Figures 2 and 6 in A fast non-reversible MCMC scheme for Bayesian finite mixture models (Ascolani and Zanella).

It includes the following files:

- "Functions_priori.R", which contains the functions to implement both reversible and non-reversible samplers.

- "Prior_mixtures.R", which contains the code to replicate Figure 2. See Section 6.1 for the details of the simulation.

- "Comparison_variant.R", which contains the code to replicate Figure 6. See Section A in the Supplementary Material for the details of the simulation.
