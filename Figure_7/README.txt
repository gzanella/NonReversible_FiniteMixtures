This folder contains the code to replicate Figure 7 in A fast non-reversible MCMC scheme for Bayesian finite mixture models (Ascolani and Zanella).

It includes the following files:

- "Functions_poisson.R", which contains the functions to implement both reversible and non-reversible samplers.

- "Poisson_mixtures.R", which contains the code to replicate Figure 7. See Section B of the Supplementary Material for the details of the simulation.
