This folder contains the code to replicate Figures 1/3/5 in A fast non-reversible MCMC scheme for Bayesian finite mixture models (Ascolani and Zanella).

It includes the following files:

- "Functions_normal.R", which contains the functions to implement both reversible and non-reversible samplers.

- "Normal_mixtures1.R", which contains the code to replicate Figure 1. See Section 1.3 for the details of the simulation.

- "Normal_mixtures2.R", which contains the code to replicate Figure 3. See Section 6.2 for the details of the simulation.

- "Normal_mixtures3.R", which contains the code to replicate Figure 5. See Section 6.4 for the details of the simulation.
